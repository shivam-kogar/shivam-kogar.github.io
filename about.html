        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <section>
            <p>
                My name is Shivam and I grew up in Bangkok and Singapore — and now live in Providence, Rhode Island. 
                Being raised in a tight-knit Indian diaspora community, I saw firsthand how immigration shapes culture, language, and even diet. 
                To this day, my grandma speaks a unique blend of Punjabi (from her parents), Thai (from her life in Thailand), and English (from her time in Singapore): 
                a unique mix that’s unfamiliar to most outsiders but feels just like home to me. I’m a third-culture kid; each place I’ve called home has felt, to some extent, transitory. 
                Though being a vagabond comes with its challenges, it also offers a kind of freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up spending holidays with relatives in India, and learning more about my heritage is an ongoing mission. 
                I hope for the opportunity to see more of India—in particular, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, and the natural beauty of Kashmir. 
                I would l also love to explore South, West, and Northeast India, and reflect more deeply on this land of immense multitudes which, even from afar—and despite never having lived there—feels like a part of me.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Even while we are spread out over countries and continents, I continue to learn so much from my family. 
                My brother is a budding entrepreneur, and his idealism and passion for his business constantly inspires me. 
                I’m lucky to come from a family with a wide range of careers and callings, from elementary school education to university-level physics research. 
                Growing up around such diverse paths taught me early on that a fulfilling life can take so many different forms.
